# etmem for Tiered Memory Expansion

## Introduction
The development of CPU computing power - particularly lower costs of ARM cores - makes memory cost and capacity become the core frustration that restricts business costs and performance. Therefore, the most pressing issue is how to save memory cost and how to expand memory capacity.

etmem is a tiered memory expansion technology that uses DRAM+memory compression/high-performance storage media to form tiered memory storage. Memory data is tiered, and cold data is migrated from memory media to high-performance storage media to release memory space and reduce memory costs. (Currently, non-volatile memory media are not supported.)

## Software Architecture
![](./figures/etmem-system-architecture-en.png)

The etmem client interacts with the server through the socket communication mechanism and delivers commands for adding, deleting, starting, stopping, and querying a project. The server reads the project management configuration information and engine configuration information from the configuration file delivered by the client, and performs the operations delivered by the client. After a project is started, the server scans service processes and evicts pages by tier based on the scanning statistics and eviction policy to save memory.


## Compilation Tutorial

1. Download the etmem source code.
```
   # git clone https://gitee.com/src-openeuler/etmem.git
```
2. Install the compilation and running dependency.

   The compilation and running of etmem depend on the libboundscheck component.

   Install the libboundscheck component.
   ```
   yum install libboundscheck
   ```
   Confirm whether it is installed through the rpm package.
   ```
   rpm -qa |grep libboundscheck
   ```

3. Build source code.
```
   # cd etmem
   # mkdir build
   # cd build
   # cmake ..
   # make
```

# etmemd -l 0 -s etmemd_socket
```
#### Printing Help Information
```
options:
-l|--log-level <log-level>  Log level
-s|--socket <sockect name>  Socket name to listen to
-h|--help  Show this message
```
#### Command-Line Options

| Option           | Description                           | Mandatory (Yes/No)| With Parameters (Yes/No)| Value Range             | Example Description                                                    |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------- | ---------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `-l` or `--log-level` | etmemd log level                    | No      | Yes        | 0 to 3                  | `0`: debug level. `1`: info level. `2`: warning level. `3`: error level. Only logs of the level that is higher than or equal to the configured level are recorded in the `/var/log/message` file.|
| `-s` or `--socket`    | Name of the etmemd listener, which is used to interact with the client| Yes      | Yes        | A string of fewer than 107 characters| Name of the server listener.                                        |

### etmem Configuration File

Before running the etmem process, the administrator needs to plan the processes that require memory expansion, configure the process information in the etmem configuration file, and configure the memory scan loops and times, and cold and hot memory thresholds.

The example configuration file is stored in `conf/example_conf.yaml` of the root directory of the source code in the source package. You are advised to store the example configuration file in the `/etc/etmem/` directory. The following is an example:

```
options:    
	loop : 3
    interval : 1
    sleep: 2
	policies:
		type : pid/name
   		value : 123456/mysql
    	max_threads: 3
    	engine : slide
			param:
				T: 3
```

Fields in the configuration file are described as follows.

| **Configuration Item**   | **Description**                                              | **Mandatory (Yes/No)**| **With Parameters (Yes/No)**| **Value Range**             | **Example Description**                                                |

Each thread processes the memory scan and operation tasks of a process or child process.| No          | Yes            | 1 to 2 x Number of cores + 1. The default value is `1`.| This configuration item controls the number of internal processing threads of etmemd. When the target process has multiple child processes, a larger value of this configuration item indicates a larger number of concurrent executions but more occupied resources.|
| engine      | Engine type                                                | Yes          | Yes            | `slide`                     | The `slide` engine is used to identify cold and hot memory.                           |

# etmem project del -n test -s etmemd_socket
```
Query a project.
```
# etmem project show -s etmemd_socket
```
Print help information.
```
# etmem project help

### Starting and Stopping an etmem Project

#### Scenario Description

After adding a project by running the `etmem project add` command, the administrator can start or stop the etmem project before running the `etmem project del` command to delete the project.

1. The administrator starts an added project.

2. The administrator stops a project that has been started.

When the administrator runs the `project del` command to delete a project, the project automatically stops if it has been started.

#### How to Use

Start or stop a project using the etmem binary file. Ensure that the server is running properly, the content of the configuration file (for example, `/etc/etmem/example_conf.yaml`) is correct, and the etmem project has been added.

Start a project.
```
# etmem migrate start -n test -s etmemd_socket
```
Stop a project.
```
# etmem migrate stop -n test -s etmemd_socket
```
Print help information.
```
# etmem migrate help
```
#### Printing Help Information
```
Usage:
 etmem migrate start [options]
 etmem migrate stop [options]
 etmem migrate help

 Options:
 -n|--name <proj_name> Add project name
 -s|--sock <sock_name> Socket name to connect

 Notes:
 Project name and socket name must be given when execute start or stop option.
```
